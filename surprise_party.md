# Surprise Party

Don't **[VERB]** anyone, it's a secret! We are **[VERB]** a surprise **[NOUN]**
for my **[ADJECTIVE]** friend. Here's how a **[ADJECTIVE]** party works:
First, ask guests to **[VERB]** a **[ADJECTIVE]** gift and to arrive early
so they don't **[VERB]** the surprise. Next, **[VERB]** the guest of honor
to **[VERB]** you at the **[NOUN]** and time of the party, but don't **[VERB]**
them why. Then, **[VERB]** for the party with **[NOUN]** and **[NOUN]**. When
the **[NOUN]** **[VERB]**, everyone **[VERB]** "Surprise!".

I think surprise parties are **[ADJECTIVE]**!
